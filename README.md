# WeatherApp_ALX
This is my capstone project for the ALX certification. It showcases what I have learned over the past six months.
A fast and modern weather application built with Vite and React. Users can get up-to-date weather forecasts by searching for a city, allowing them to adjust their plans according to current and future weather conditions.

**Key Features:**
*   Display real-time weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
*   Search for weather forecasts in any city worldwide.
*   Provide a responsive and intuitive user interface.
## Technologies Used
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Vite
    *   React.js
    *   CSS3
*   **APIs:**
    *   OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
*   **Build Tools:**
    *   npm
## Usage
To use the application, simply type the name of a city into the search bar and press `Enter`. The app will then display the current weather conditions for that location.
